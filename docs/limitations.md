# Limitations

This study is based on **synthetically generated financial data** due to the unavailability of **real stock and fundamental data** from freely accessible sources. Multiple data sources were explored, including:

- **Stock Exchange Websites** (NSE, BSE, screener) – Limited access of 10 year historical financials and only partial datasets available.
- **Financial APIs** (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, yahooquery) – Free versions provided only **incomplete or limited data**, while comprehensive access required paid subscriptions.
- **Company Filings & Reports** (SEBI, Annual Reports) – Available data lacked the structured format needed for large-scale portfolio optimization.
- **Web Scraping** – Restricted by website policies and inconsistent data formats.

Despite these efforts, **real-time and complete fundamental data** for a large universe of stocks (NIFTY 500) remained inaccessible without premium services.

While the **synthetic data** has been generated to **closely mimic real-world financial trends**, it may not fully capture **market anomalies, economic cycles, corporate actions, or firm-specific risks** that influence actual stock performance.

## Future Improvements
- **Incorporate real financial data from paid sources** for more accurate results.
- **Explore alternative data sources**
