## **Financial Ratios: The DNA of a Company**  
Financial ratios are like a **company’s medical report**—investors, analysts, and managers use them to assess profitability, risk, and efficiency. These ratios fall into five main categories:  

---

### **1. Profitability Ratios – “Is the company making money?”**  
These measure how efficiently a company generates profit.  

- **Earnings Per Share (EPS):**  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    EPS = (Net Income - Preferred Dividends) / Weighted Average Shares Outstanding
    ```  
  - *Real-world use:* Investors love high and growing EPS—it signals a **profitable** company.  

- **Return on Equity (ROE):** Measures how efficiently a company generates profit from shareholders’ equity.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    ROE = Net Income / Shareholders' Equity
    ```  
  - *Example:* If ROE is 20%, the company earns **$0.20 per dollar of shareholder investment**.  

- **Return on Assets (ROA):** Evaluates how efficiently a company uses its assets.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    ROA = Net Income / Total Assets
    ```  
  - *Why it matters:* A high ROA means strong asset utilization—important in asset-heavy industries like real estate.  

- **Return on Capital Employed (ROCE):** Measures profitability in relation to capital used (both debt and equity).  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    ROCE = EBIT / Total Capital Employed
    ```  
  - *Use case:* Private equity firms use ROCE to determine if a company is using capital efficiently.

### **2. Valuation Ratios – “Is the stock overvalued or undervalued?”**  
These help investors determine if a company’s stock price makes sense.  

- **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** Compares a company’s stock price to its earnings.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    P/E = Market Price per Share / EPS
    ```  
  - *Example:* If Tesla’s P/E is 40 and Ford’s is 10, Tesla is priced higher for future growth expectations.  

- **Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio:** Compares market value to book value (net assets).  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    P/B = Market Price per Share / Book Value per Share
    ```  
  - *Use case:* Used in banking and real estate sectors to assess undervaluation.  

- **Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA):** Measures a company’s total value relative to operating earnings.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash
    EV/EBITDA = Enterprise Value / EBITDA
    ```  
  - *Example:* Private equity firms use this to compare companies across industries.  

- **Dividend Yield:** Measures how much cash return investors get from dividends.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Dividend Yield = Annual Dividend per Share / Stock Price
    ```  
  - *Use case:* Important for income investors (e.g., retirees looking for stable cash flows).

### **3. Leverage & Solvency Ratios – “How much debt is too much?”**  
These ratios assess **financial risk** by evaluating debt levels.  

- **Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio:** Measures how much a company relies on debt vs. equity.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    D/E = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
    ```  
  - *Example:* If a company has a D/E of 3.0, it has **three times more debt than equity**—risky in downturns.  

- **Interest Coverage Ratio:** Shows if a company can pay its interest expenses.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Interest Coverage = EBIT / Interest Expense
    ```  
  - *Use case:* Banks use this ratio before lending money.  

- **Current Ratio:** Measures a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
    ```  
  - *Real-world use:* If the ratio is <1, the company may struggle to pay short-term debts.  

- **Quick Ratio (Acid Test):** More stringent than the current ratio—excludes inventory.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
    ```  
  - *Example:* Tech firms usually have high quick ratios since they hold little inventory.

### **4. Efficiency & Operating Ratios – “How well does the company run?”**  
These measure operational efficiency.  

- **Asset Turnover Ratio:** Shows how efficiently a company uses assets to generate revenue.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Asset Turnover = Revenue / Total Assets
    ```  
  - *Use case:* Retail companies like Walmart have **high turnover**, while utilities have low.  

- **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** Measures how quickly a company sells inventory.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Inventory Turnover = Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) / Average Inventory
    ```  
  - *Example:* Amazon has a **high inventory turnover** (fast-moving products), while Rolex has a low ratio (luxury watches take longer to sell).  

---

### **5. Risk & Return Ratios – “How does the company perform against risk?”**  

- **Beta:** Measures stock volatility relative to the market.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    β = Covariance (r_stock, r_market) / Variance (r_market)
    ```  
  - *Use case:* High-beta stocks (e.g., tech) are riskier but offer higher returns.  

- **Sharpe Ratio:** Measures risk-adjusted returns.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Sharpe Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation
    ```  
  - *Use case:* If two portfolios have the same return, the one with the higher Sharpe Ratio is **better**.  

- **Sortino Ratio:** Like Sharpe, but focuses only on downside risk.  
  - Formula:  
    ```
    Sortino Ratio = (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Downside Deviation
    ```  
  - *Use case:* Used by hedge funds managing risk-averse investors’ money.  

- **Max Drawdown:** Measures the worst peak-to-trough loss in a portfolio.  
  - *Use case:* Essential in stress-testing investment strategies.
